# crypto_homework

This repo contains solutions to one homework I had to do in cryptography.

The topics contained here are as follows:

1. Elgamal encryption system example (Be aware not to use this in any real world application, but it does work as a text book example).
  - It contains also examples for how to attack elgamal. Once you run the script it will output explanations on whats going on.
2. Textbook RSA based hashing function attack.
3. An example of the "Håstad’s Broadcast Attack"
4. An example of a MAC (its a simple MAC that isn't really practiccal, it's just to show how a MAC can be used)
4. Zero-knowledge explanation, whats is soundness, completeness and zero-knowledge. There is a broken algorithm and an analisys
on if the broken algorithm satisfies the zero-knowledge protocol.

Anyway, this is all done for a MSc assignment in cryptography course and I'm not maintaining it. Use it to learn crypto, fork it, 
or use as teaching material. 


With best,

Gerd
